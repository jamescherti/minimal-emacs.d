## Introduction

The **minimal-emacs.d** project is a lightweight and optimized Emacs base (`init.el` and `early-init.el`) that **gives you full control over your configuration** (without the complexity of, for instance, Doom Emacs or Spacemacs). It provides better defaults, an optimized startup, and a clean foundation for building your own vanilla Emacs setup.

Building the *minimal-emacs.d* `init.el` and `early-init.el` was the result of **extensive research and testing** to fine-tune the best parameters and optimizations for an Emacs configuration. *(More information about the *minimal-emacs.d* features can be found here: [Features](#features).)*

**Here are the instructions for installing minimal-emacs.d:** [Install minimal-emacs.d](#install-minimal-emacsd).

## Looking for the ideal starter kit to customize Emacs? You have found it.

The *minimal-emacs.d* project is:
- **Minimal yet effective:** A solid starting point.
- **Better defaults:** Improved settings for usability, UI, garbage collection, and built-in packages.
- **0 packages loaded / No forced modes:** Unlike other frameworks or starter kits, *minimal-emacs.d* does not impose modes or require packages. **You have full control** over which global or minor modes to enable and which packages to load with `require`.
- **Customizable foundation:** Designed to be extended, not replaced. This README.md offers extensive recommendations for customizing your *minimal-emacs.d* configuration. (Reminder: [Never modify init.el and early-init.el. Modify these instead...](#customizations-never-modify-initel-and-early-initel-modify-these-instead))

The *minimal-emacs.d* project includes two initialization files:
- `early-init.el`: Loaded early in the Emacs startup process, before the graphical interface is initialized. Introduced in Emacs 27, this file configures settings that influence startup performance and GUI behavior prior to package loading.
- `init.el`: Loaded after the graphical interface is initialized. This file contains user customizations, including variable settings, package loading, mode configurations, and keybindings.

### Startup

The author uses *minimal-emacs.d* as his `early-init.el` and `init.el`, alongside **146 packages** ([See the packages that the author is using here](https://www.jamescherti.com/essential-emacs-packages/)). Yet, thanks to its efficient design, Emacs still **starts in just 0.22 seconds**:

![](https://www.jamescherti.com/wp-content/uploads/minimal-emacs-startup-time.png)

In addition to *minimal-emacs.d*, startup speed is influenced by your computer's processing power and disk speed. To establish a baseline, start Emacs with only *minimal-emacs.d* and no additional configurations, then run `M-x emacs-init-time`. Incrementally modify your init files and observe the impact on startup time. For consistent comparisons, always test on the same computer and Emacs version. It's also important to ensure that all packages are deferred using `:defer t` and `:commands`, which makes Emacs load them only when needed (see additional examples in this README.md). While startup time is important, other factors, like native compilation, are even more important. Although native compilation may introduce some brief initial and negligible initial delay, it is beneficial in the long run as it significantly speeds up Emacs.

## Install minimal-emacs.d

- **Important:** Ensure that the `~/.emacs` and `~/.emacs.el` files do not exist. These files cause Emacs to ignore `~/.emacs.d/init.el`. This behavior is due to the way Emacs searches for initialization files ([more information](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Find-Init.html#Find-Init)). **Simply delete the *~/.emacs* and *~/.emacs.el* files avoid this issue.**
- **Debug:** If a package or any other functionality is not working as expected, start Emacs with `emacs --debug-init` to enable debug mode and obtain the backtrace.
- **Prerequisite:** git

### Install minimal-emacs.d into `~/.emacs.d`

Execute the following command install this repository into `~/.emacs.d`:
```
git clone https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
```

### Alternative: Install minimal-emacs.d into `~/.minimal-emacs.d`

To install *minimal-emacs.d* in a non-default directory, use the `--init-directory` Emacs option to specify your desired configuration path. For example, to install *minimal-emacs.d* in `~/.minimal-emacs.d/`, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository into `~/.minimal-emacs.d/` using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jamescherti/minimal-emacs.d ~/.minimal-emacs.d
   ```

2. Start Emacs with the new configuration directory:
   ```
   emacs --init-directory ~/.minimal-emacs.d/
   ```

## Update minimal-emacs.d

To keep your Emacs configuration up to date, you can pull the latest changes from the repository. Run the following command in your terminal:
```
git -C ~/.emacs.d pull
```

## Customizations: Never modify init.el and early-init.el. Modify these instead...
**The `init.el` and `early-init.el` files should never be modified directly** because they are intended to be managed by Git during an update.

The minimal-emacs.d init files support additional customization files that are loaded at different stages of the Emacs startup process. These files allow you to further customize the initialization sequence:

- `~/.emacs.d/pre-init.el`: This file is loaded before `init.el`. Use it to set up variables or configurations that need to be available early in the initialization process but after `early-init.el`.

- `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`: This file is loaded after `init.el`. It is useful for additional configurations or package setups that depend on the configurations in `init.el`.

- `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`: This file is loaded before `early-init.el`. Use it for configurations that need to be set even earlier in the startup sequence, typically affecting the initial setup of the Emacs environment.

- `~/.emacs.d/post-early-init.el`: This file is loaded after `early-init.el` but before `init.el`. It is useful for setting up configurations that depend on the early initialization but need to be set before the main initialization begins.

Always begin your `pre-init.el`, `post-init.el`, `post-early-init.el`, and `pre-early-init.el` files with the following header to prevent them from being byte-compiled and to activate lexical binding:
```elisp
;;; FILENAME.el --- DESCRIPTION -*- no-byte-compile: t; lexical-binding: t; -*-
```

Replace `FILENAME.el` with the actual name and DESCRIPTION with a brief description of its purpose.

*(Only if you know what you're doing: Removing `no-byte-compile: t;` from your init files allows Emacs to compile them, improving load and execution speed. However, if you do so, you may need to add required dependencies. For example, if you're using `use-package`, add `(require 'use-package)` at the top of `post-init.el` to ensure all necessary `use-package` variables and functions are loaded.)*

**Important:** The examples in this README reference pre/post init files in the `~/.emacs.d/` directory, but the files `pre-early-init.el`, `post-early-init.el`, `pre-init.el`, and `post-init.el` should be placed in the same directory as `init.el` and `early-init.el`, regardless of their location.

## Debug on error

During the development of your init files, the author strongly recommends adding the following line at the very beginning of your `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el` file:

```elisp
(setq debug-on-error t)
```

Enabling `debug-on-error` at this stage allows you to catch errors that might otherwise cause Emacs to fail silently or behave unpredictably.

## Customizations: UI (pre-early-init.el)

### How to enable the menu-bar, the tool-bar, dialogs, the contextual menu, and tooltips?

**Note:** Enabling the tool-bar or menu-bar may slightly increase your startup time.

To customize your Emacs setup to include various user interface elements, you can use the following settings in your ``~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el``:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq minimal-emacs-ui-features '(context-menu tool-bar menu-bar dialogs tooltips))
```

These settings control the visibility of dialogs, context menus, toolbars, menu bars, and tooltips.

## Customizations: Packages (post-init.el)

This README.md offers guidance on installing optional external packages. While Emacs and minimal-emacs.d are fully functional without them, the recommended packages can enhance your experience and introduce additional features, which is why they are suggested.

### Optimization: Native Compilation

Native compilation enhances Emacs performance by converting Elisp code into native machine code, resulting in faster execution and improved responsiveness.

1. To check if native compilation is enabled, evaluate:
   ```elisp
   (native-comp-available-p)
   ```
   (A non-nil result indicates that native compilation is active.)

2. Ensure all libraries are byte-compiled and native-compiled using [compile-angel.el](https://github.com/jamescherti/compile-angel.el). To install compile-angel, add the following code at the very beginning of your `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el` file, before all other packages:
```emacs-lisp
;; Native compilation enhances Emacs performance by converting Elisp code into
;; native machine code, resulting in faster execution and improved
;; responsiveness.
;;
;; Ensure adding the following compile-angel code at the very beginning
;; of your `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el` file, before all other packages.
(use-package compile-angel
  :ensure t
  :demand t
  :custom
  ;; Set `compile-angel-verbose` to nil to suppress output from compile-angel.
  ;; Drawback: The minibuffer will not display compile-angel's actions.
  (compile-angel-verbose t)

  :config
  ;; The following directive prevents compile-angel from compiling your init
  ;; files. If you choose to remove this push to `compile-angel-excluded-files'
  ;; and compile your pre/post-init files, ensure you understand the
  ;; implications and thoroughly test your code. For example, if you're using
  ;; `use-package', you'll need to explicitly add `(require 'use-package)` at
  ;; the top of your init file.
  (push "/init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)
  (push "/early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)
  (push "/pre-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)
  (push "/post-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)
  (push "/pre-early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)
  (push "/post-early-init.el" compile-angel-excluded-files)

  ;; A local mode that compiles .el files whenever the user saves them.
  ;; (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'compile-angel-on-save-local-mode)

  ;; A global mode that compiles .el files before they are loaded.
  (compile-angel-on-load-mode))
```

### How to activate recentf, savehist, saveplace, and auto-revert?

The recentf, savehist, saveplace, and auto-revert built-in packages are already configured by *minimal-emacs.d*. All you need to do is activate them by adding the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Auto-revert in Emacs is a feature that automatically updates the
;; contents of a buffer to reflect changes made to the underlying file
;; on disk.
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'global-auto-revert-mode)

;; recentf is an Emacs package that maintains a list of recently
;; accessed files, making it easier to reopen files you have worked on
;; recently.
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'(lambda()
                               (let ((inhibit-message t))
                                 (recentf-mode 1))))

(with-eval-after-load "recentf"
  (add-hook 'kill-emacs-hook #'recentf-cleanup))

;; savehist is an Emacs feature that preserves the minibuffer history between
;; sessions. It saves the history of inputs in the minibuffer, such as commands,
;; search strings, and other prompts, to a file. This allows users to retain
;; their minibuffer history across Emacs restarts.
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'savehist-mode)

;; save-place-mode enables Emacs to remember the last location within a file
;; upon reopening. This feature is particularly beneficial for resuming work at
;; the precise point where you previously left off.
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'save-place-mode)
```

### Activating autosave

#### auto-save-mode (Prevent data loss in case of crashes)

Enabling `auto-save-mode` mitigates the risk of data loss in the event of a crash. Auto-saved data can be recovered using the `recover-file` or `recover-session` functions.

To enable autosave, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:

```emacs-lisp
;; Enable `auto-save-mode' to prevent data loss. Use `recover-file' or
;; `recover-session' to restore unsaved changes.
(setq auto-save-default t)

(setq auto-save-interval 300)
(setq auto-save-timeout 30)
```

#### auto-save-visited-mode (Save file buffers after a few seconds of inactivity)

When `auto-save-visited-mode` is enabled, Emacs will auto-save file-visiting buffers after a certain amount of idle time if the user forgets to save it with `save-buffer` or `C-x s` for example.

This is different from `auto-save-mode`: `auto-save-mode` periodically saves all modified buffers, creating backup files, including those not associated with a file, while `auto-save-visited-mode` only saves file-visiting buffers after a period of idle time, directly saving to the file itself without creating backup files.

``` emacs-lisp
;; When auto-save-visited-mode is enabled, Emacs will auto-save file-visiting
;; buffers after a certain amount of idle time if the user forgets to save it
;; with save-buffer or C-x s for example.
;;
;; This is different from auto-save-mode: auto-save-mode periodically saves
;; all modified buffers, creating backup files, including those not associated
;; with a file, while auto-save-visited-mode only saves file-visiting buffers
;; after a period of idle time, directly saving to the file itself without
;; creating backup files.
(setq auto-save-visited-interval 5)   ; Save after 5 seconds if inactivity
(auto-save-visited-mode 1)
```

### Code completion with corfu

[Corfu](https://github.com/minad/corfu) enhances in-buffer completion by displaying a compact popup with current candidates, positioned either below or above the point. Candidates can be selected by navigating up or down.

Cape, or Completion At Point Extensions, extends the capabilities of in-buffer completion. It integrates with Corfu or the default completion UI, by providing additional backends through completion-at-point-functions.

![](https://github.com/minad/corfu/blob/screenshots/popupinfo-dark.png?raw=true)

To configure `corfu` and `cape`, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Corfu enhances in-buffer completion by displaying a compact popup with
;; current candidates, positioned either below or above the point. Candidates
;; can be selected by navigating up or down.
(use-package corfu
  :ensure t
  :commands (corfu-mode global-corfu-mode)

  :hook ((prog-mode . corfu-mode)
         (shell-mode . corfu-mode)
         (eshell-mode . corfu-mode))

  :custom
  ;; Hide commands in M-x which do not apply to the current mode.
  (read-extended-command-predicate #'command-completion-default-include-p)
  ;; Disable Ispell completion function. As an alternative try `cape-dict'.
  (text-mode-ispell-word-completion nil)
  (tab-always-indent 'complete)

  ;; Enable Corfu
  :config
  (global-corfu-mode))

;; Cape, or Completion At Point Extensions, extends the capabilities of
;; in-buffer completion. It integrates with Corfu or the default completion UI,
;; by providing additional backends through completion-at-point-functions.
(use-package cape
  :ensure t
  :commands (cape-dabbrev cape-file cape-elisp-block)
  :bind ("C-c p" . cape-prefix-map)
  :init
  ;; Add to the global default value of `completion-at-point-functions' which is
  ;; used by `completion-at-point'.
  (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-dabbrev)
  (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-file)
  (add-hook 'completion-at-point-functions #'cape-elisp-block))
```

### Configuring Vertico, Consult, and Embark

[Vertico](https://github.com/minad/vertico), [Consult](https://github.com/minad/consult), and [Embark](https://github.com/oantolin/embark) collectively enhance Emacs' completion and navigation capabilities.

Vertico provides a vertical completion interface, making it easier to navigate and select from completion candidates (e.g., when `M-x` is pressed).

Consult offers a suite of commands for efficient searching, previewing, and interacting with buffers, file contents, and more, improving various tasks.

Embark integrates with these tools to provide context-sensitive actions and quick access to commands based on the current selection, further improving user efficiency and workflow within Emacs. Together, they create a cohesive and powerful environment for managing completions and interactions.

![](https://github.com/minad/consult/blob/screenshots/consult-grep.gif?raw=true)

Add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el` to set up Vertico, Consult, and Embark:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Vertico provides a vertical completion interface, making it easier to
;; navigate and select from completion candidates (e.g., when `M-x` is pressed).
(use-package vertico
  ;; (Note: It is recommended to also enable the savehist package.)
  :ensure t
  :config
  (vertico-mode))

;; Vertico leverages Orderless' flexible matching capabilities, allowing users
;; to input multiple patterns separated by spaces, which Orderless then
;; matches in any order against the candidates.
(use-package orderless
  :ensure t

  (completion-category-defaults nil)
  (completion-category-overrides '((file (styles partial-completion)))))

;; Marginalia allows Embark to offer you preconfigured actions in more contexts.
;; In addition to that, Marginalia also enhances Vertico by adding rich
;; annotations to the completion candidates displayed in Vertico's interface.
(use-package marginalia
  :ensure t

### Code folding

The built-in `outline-minor-mode` provides structured code folding in modes such as Emacs Lisp and Python, allowing users to collapse and expand sections based on headings or indentation levels. This feature enhances navigation and improves the management of large files with hierarchical structures.

Alternatively, `hs-minor-mode` offers basic code folding for blocks defined by curly braces, functions, or other language-specific delimiters. However, for more flexible folding that supports multiple nested levels, `outline-minor-mode` is generally the preferred choice, as it enables finer control over section visibility in deeply structured code.

For example, to enable `outline-minor-mode` in Emacs Lisp:

``` emacs-lisp
;; The built-in outline-minor-mode provides structured code folding in modes
;; such as Emacs Lisp and Python, allowing users to collapse and expand sections
;; based on headings or indentation levels. This feature enhances navigation and
;; improves the management of large files with hierarchical structures.
(use-package outline
  :ensure nil
  :commands outline-minor-mode
  :hook
  ((emacs-lisp-mode . outline-minor-mode)
   ;; Use " ▼" instead of the default ellipsis "..." for folded text to make
   ;; folds more visually distinctive and readable.
   (outline-minor-mode
    .
    (lambda()
      (let* ((display-table (or buffer-display-table (make-display-table)))
             (face-offset (* (face-id 'shadow) (ash 1 22)))
             (value (vconcat (mapcar (lambda (c) (+ face-offset c)) " ▼"))))
        (set-display-table-slot display-table 'selective-display value)
        (setq buffer-display-table display-table))))))
```

For folding based on indentation levels, the **[outline-indent](https://github.com/jamescherti/outline-indent.el)** Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables folding according to the indentation structure:
```elisp
;; The outline-indent Emacs package provides a minor mode that enables code
;; folding based on indentation levels.
;;
;; In addition to code folding, *outline-indent* allows:
;; - Moving indented blocks up and down
;; - Indenting/unindenting to adjust indentation levels
;; - Inserting a new line with the same indentation level as the current line
;; - Move backward/forward to the indentation level of the current line
;; - and other features.
(use-package outline-indent
  :ensure t
  :commands outline-indent-minor-mode

  :custom
  (outline-indent-ellipsis " ▼")

  :init
  ;; The minor mode can also be automatically activated for a certain modes.
  (add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
  (add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)

  (add-hook 'yaml-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode)
  (add-hook 'yaml-ts-mode-hook #'outline-indent-minor-mode))
```

### Changing the default theme

For instance, to switch to a another theme than the default one, add the following to the `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el` file:

```emacs-lisp
(mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes)  ; Disable all active themes
(load-theme 'modus-operandi t)  ; Load the built-in theme
```

(If you prefer dark themes, replace `modus-operandi` with `modus-vivendi`.)

Emacs includes several built-in themes that you can use without installing additional packages:

- `tango-dark` (Face colors using the Tango palette. Dark background.)
- `tango` (Face colors using the Tango palette. Light background.)
- `modus-operandi`
- `modus-operandi-deuteranopia`
- `modus-operandi-tinted`
- `modus-operandi-tritanopia`
- `modus-vivendi`
- `modus-vivendi-deuteranopia`
- `modus-vivendi-tinted`
- `modus-vivendi-tritanopia`
- `tsdh-dark` (A dark theme used and created by Tassilo Horn.)
- `tsdh-light` (A light Emacs theme.)
- `adwaita` (Face colors similar to the default theme of Gnome 3 / Adwaita.)
- `deeper-blue` (Face colors using a deep blue background.)
- `dichromacy` (Face colors suitable for red/green color-blind users.)
- `leuven-dark` (Face colors with a dark background.)
- `leuven` (Face colors with a light background.)
- `light-blue` (Face colors utilizing a light blue background.)
- `manoj-dark` (Very high contrast faces with a black background.)
- `misterioso` (Predominantly blue/cyan faces on a dark cyan background.)
- `wheatgrass` (High-contrast green/blue/brown faces on a black background.)
- `whiteboard` (Face colors similar to markers on a whiteboard.)
- `wombat` (Medium-contrast faces with a dark gray background.)

(To experiment with different themes, use `M-x customize-themes`.)

If you're interested in exploring third-party Emacs themes, consider the following:
- `ef-themes` (available on MELPA): A collection of light and dark themes for GNU Emacs, designed to offer colorful yet highly legible options. They are aimed at users seeking something with more visual flair compared to the more minimalist *modus-themes*.
- `doom-themes` (available on MELPA): An extensive collection of high-quality, visually appealing themes for Emacs, designed to offer a sleek and modern aesthetic, while drawing inspiration from popular community themes.
- `tomorrow-night-deepblue-theme` (available on MELPA): A beautiful deep blue variant of the Tomorrow Night theme, which is renowned for its elegant color palette. It features a deep blue background color that creates a calming atmosphere. This theme is a great choice for those who miss the blue themes that were trendy a few years ago. (The theme was inspired by classic text editors such as QuickBASIC, RHIDE, and Turbo Pascal, as well as tools such as Midnight Commander.)

### Automatic removal of trailing whitespace on save

**Trailing whitespace** refers to any spaces or tabs that appear after the last non-whitespace character on a line. These characters have no semantic value and can lead to unnecessary diffs in version control, inconsistent formatting, or visual clutter. Removing them improves code clarity and consistency.

The [stripspace](https://github.com/jamescherti/stripspace.el) Emacs package provides `stripspace-local-mode`, a minor mode that automatically removes trailing whitespace and blank lines at the end of the buffer when saving.

To enable **stripspace** and automatically delete trailing whitespace, add the following configuration to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```elisp
;; The stripspace Emacs package provides stripspace-local-mode, a minor mode
;; that automatically removes trailing whitespace and blank lines at the end of
;; the buffer when saving.
(use-package stripspace
  :ensure t
  :commands stripspace-local-mode

  ;; Enable for prog-mode-hook, text-mode-hook, conf-mode-hook
  :hook ((prog-mode . stripspace-local-mode)
         (text-mode . stripspace-local-mode)
         (conf-mode . stripspace-local-mode))

  :custom
  ;; The `stripspace-only-if-initially-clean' option:
  ;; - nil to always delete trailing whitespace.
  ;; - Non-nil to only delete whitespace when the buffer is clean initially.
  ;; (The initial cleanliness check is performed when `stripspace-local-mode'
  ;; is enabled.)
  (stripspace-only-if-initially-clean nil)

  ;; Enabling `stripspace-restore-column' preserves the cursor's column position
  ;; even after stripping spaces. This is useful in scenarios where you add
  ;; extra spaces and then save the file. Although the spaces are removed in the
  ;; saved file, the cursor remains in the same position, ensuring a consistent
  ;; editing experience without affecting cursor placement.
  (stripspace-restore-column t))
```

### Enhancing undo/redo

The undo-fu package is a lightweight wrapper around Emacs' built-in undo system, providing more convenient undo/redo functionality while preserving access to the full undo history. The undo-fu-session package complements undo-fu by enabling the saving and restoration of undo history across Emacs sessions, even after restarting.

The default undo system in Emacs has two main issues that undo-fu fixes:

1. **Redo requires two steps**: To redo an action after undoing, you need to press a key twice, which can be annoying and inefficient.
2. **Accidental over-redo**: When redoing, it's easy to go too far back, past the point where you started the undo, which makes it hard to return to the exact state you wanted to restore.

To install and configure these packages, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```emacs-lisp
;; The undo-fu package is a lightweight wrapper around Emacs' built-in undo
;; system, providing more convenient undo/redo functionality.
(use-package undo-fu
  :ensure t
  :commands (undo-fu-only-undo
             undo-fu-only-redo
             undo-fu-only-redo-all
             undo-fu-disable-checkpoint)
  :config
  (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-z") 'undo-fu-only-undo)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-z") 'undo-fu-only-redo))

;; The undo-fu-session package complements undo-fu by enabling the saving
;; and restoration of undo history across Emacs sessions, even after restarting.
(use-package undo-fu-session
  :ensure t
  :commands undo-fu-session-global-mode
  :hook (after-init . undo-fu-session-global-mode))
```

### Configuring Vim keybindings using Evil?

Configuring Vim keybindings in Emacs can greatly enhance your editing efficiency if you are accustomed to Vim's modal editing style. Add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el` to set up [Evil mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil):

``` emacs-lisp
;; Uncomment the following if you are using undo-fu
;; (setq evil-undo-system 'undo-fu)

;; Vim emulation
(use-package evil
  :ensure t
  :commands (evil-mode evil-define-key)
  :hook (after-init . evil-mode)

  :init
  ;; It has to be defined before evil
  (setq evil-want-integration t)
  (setq evil-want-keybinding nil)

  :custom
  ;; Make :s in visual mode operate only on the actual visual selection
  ;; (character or block), instead of the full lines covered by the selection
  (evil-ex-visual-char-range t)
  ;; Use Vim-style regular expressions in search and substitute commands,
  ;; allowing features like \v (very magic), \zs, and \ze for precise matches
  (evil-ex-search-vim-style-regexp t)
  ;; Enable automatic horizontal split below
  (evil-split-window-below t)
  ;; Enable automatic vertical split to the right
  (evil-vsplit-window-right t)
  ;; Disable echoing Evil state to avoid replacing eldoc
  (evil-echo-state nil)
  ;; Do not move cursor back when exiting insert state
  (evil-move-cursor-back nil)
  ;; Make `v$` exclude the final newline
  (evil-v$-excludes-newline t)
  ;; Allow C-h to delete in insert state
  (evil-want-C-h-delete t)
  ;; Enable C-u to delete back to indentation in insert state
  (evil-want-C-u-delete t)
  ;; Enable fine-grained undo behavior
  (evil-want-fine-undo t)
  ;; Allow moving cursor beyond end-of-line in visual block mode
  (evil-move-beyond-eol t)
  ;; Disable wrapping of search around buffer
  (evil-search-wrap nil)
  ;; Whether Y yanks to the end of the line
  (evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol t))

(use-package evil-collection
  :after evil
  :ensure t
  :init
  ;; It has to be defined before evil-colllection
  (setq evil-collection-setup-minibuffer t)
  :config
  (evil-collection-init))
```

You can also install the [vim-tab-bar](https://github.com/jamescherti/vim-tab-bar.el) package to enhance the built-in Emacs tab-bar with a minimalist, Vim-inspired design that automatically adapts to the active Emacs theme. Beyond its Vim-inspired design, the *vim-tab-bar* package is valued by users who prioritize theme consistency, as it integrates the Emacs tab-bar with any Emacs theme, producing a visually coherent and polished interface:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Give Emacs tab-bar a style similar to Vim's
(use-package vim-tab-bar
  :ensure t
  :commands vim-tab-bar-mode
  :hook (after-init . vim-tab-bar-mode))
```

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jamescherti/vim-tab-bar.el/main/.screenshots/emacs-tab-like-vim.png)

*(The screenshot above showcases how vim-tab-bar modifies the built-in Emacs tab-bar.)*

The `evil-surround` package simplifies handling surrounding characters, such as parentheses, brackets, quotes, etc. It provides key bindings to easily add, change, or delete these surrounding characters in pairs. For instance, you can surround the currently selected text with double quotes in visual state using `S"` or `gS"`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; The evil-surround package simplifies handling surrounding characters, such as
;; parentheses, brackets, quotes, etc. It provides key bindings to easily add,
;; change, or delete these surrounding characters in pairs. For instance, you
;; can surround the currently selected text with double quotes in visual state
;; using S" or gS".
(use-package evil-surround
  :after evil
  :ensure t
  :commands global-evil-surround-mode
  :custom
  (evil-surround-pairs-alist
   '((?\( . ("(" . ")"))
     (?\[ . ("[" . "]"))
     (?\{ . ("{" . "}"))

     (?\) . ("(" . ")"))
     (?\] . ("[" . "]"))
     (?\} . ("{" . "}"))

     (?< . ("<" . ">"))
     (?> . ("<" . ">"))))
  :hook (after-init . global-evil-surround-mode))
```

You can also add the following code to enable commenting and uncommenting by pressing `gcc` in normal mode and `gc` in visual mode (thanks you to the Reddit user u/mistakenuser for this contribution, which replaces the evil-commentary package):
``` emacs-lisp
;; The following code enables commenting and uncommenting by pressing gcc in
;; normal mode and gc in visual mode.
(with-eval-after-load "evil"
  (evil-define-operator my-evil-comment-or-uncomment (beg end)
    "Toggle comment for the region between BEG and END."
    (interactive "<r>")
    (comment-or-uncomment-region beg end))
  (evil-define-key 'normal 'global (kbd "gc") 'my-evil-comment-or-uncomment))
```

### Configuring LSP Servers with Eglot (built-in)

To set up Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers using Eglot, you can configure it, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Set up the Language Server Protocol (LSP) servers using Eglot.
(use-package eglot
  :ensure nil
  :commands (eglot-ensure
             eglot-rename
             eglot-format-buffer))
```

Here is an example of how to configure Eglot to enable or disable certain options for the `pylsp` server in Python development. (Note that a third-party tool, [python-lsp-server](https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server), must be installed):

``` emacs-lisp
;; Configure Eglot to enable or disable certain options for the pylsp server
;; in Python development. (Note that a third-party tool,
;; https://github.com/python-lsp/python-lsp-server, must be installed),
(add-hook 'python-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(add-hook 'python-ts-mode-hook #'eglot-ensure)
(setq-default eglot-workspace-configuration
              `(:pylsp (:plugins
                        (;; Fix imports and syntax using `eglot-format-buffer`
                         :isort (:enabled t)
                         :autopep8 (:enabled t)

                         ;; Syntax checkers (works with Flymake)
                         :pylint (:enabled t)
                         :pycodestyle (:enabled t)
                         :flake8 (:enabled t)
                         :pyflakes (:enabled t)
                         :pydocstyle (:enabled t)
                         :mccabe (:enabled t)

                         :yapf (:enabled :json-false)
                         :rope_autoimport (:enabled :json-false)))))
```

### Session Management

The [easysession](https://github.com/jamescherti/easysession.el) Emacs package is a session manager for Emacs that can persist and restore file editing buffers, indirect buffers/clones, Dired buffers, windows/splits, the built-in tab-bar (including tabs, their buffers, and windows), and Emacs frames. It offers a convenient and effortless way to manage Emacs editing sessions and utilizes built-in Emacs functions to persist and restore frames.

To configure **easysession**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; The easysession Emacs package is a session manager for Emacs that can persist
;; and restore file editing buffers, indirect buffers/clones, Dired buffers,
;; windows/splits, the built-in tab-bar (including tabs, their buffers, and
;; windows), and Emacs frames. It offers a convenient and effortless way to
;; manage Emacs editing sessions and utilizes built-in Emacs functions to
;; persist and restore frames.
(use-package easysession
  :ensure t
  :commands (easysession-switch-to
             easysession-save-as
             easysession-save-mode
             easysession-load-including-geometry)

  :custom
  (easysession-mode-line-misc-info t)  ; Display the session in the modeline
  (easysession-save-interval (* 10 60))  ; Save every 10 minutes

  :init
  ;; Key mappings:
  ;; C-c l for switching sessions
  ;; and C-c s for saving the current session
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") 'easysession-switch-to)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c s") 'easysession-save-as)

  ;; The depth 102 and 103 have been added to to `add-hook' to ensure that the
  ;; session is loaded after all other packages. (Using 103/102 is particularly
  ;; useful for those using minimal-emacs.d, where some optimizations restore
  ;; `file-name-handler-alist` at depth 101 during `emacs-startup-hook`.)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'easysession-load-including-geometry 102)
  (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'easysession-save-mode 103))
```

### Configuring org-mode

Org mode is a major mode designed for organizing notes, planning, task management, and authoring documents using plain text with a simple and expressive markup syntax. It supports hierarchical outlines, TODO lists, scheduling, deadlines, time tracking, and exporting to multiple formats including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and Markdown.

To configure **org-mode**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```elisp
;; Org mode is a major mode designed for organizing notes, planning, task
;; management, and authoring documents using plain text with a simple and
;; expressive markup syntax. It supports hierarchical outlines, TODO lists,
;; scheduling, deadlines, time tracking, and exporting to multiple formats
;; including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and Markdown.
(use-package org
  :ensure t
  :commands (org-mode org-version)
  :mode
  ("\\.org\\'" . org-mode)
  :custom
  (org-hide-leading-stars t)
  (org-startup-indented t)
  (org-adapt-indentation nil)
  (org-edit-src-content-indentation 0)
  ;; (org-fontify-done-headline t)
  ;; (org-fontify-todo-headline t)
  ;; (org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
  ;; (org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
  (org-startup-truncated t))
```

### Configuring markdown-mode (e.g., README.md syntax)

The [markdown-mode](https://github.com/jrblevin/markdown-mode) package provides a major mode for Emacs for syntax highlighting, editing commands, and preview support for Markdown documents. It supports core Markdown syntax as well as extensions like GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM).

To configure **markdown-mode**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```elisp
;; The markdown-mode package provides a major mode for Emacs for syntax
;; highlighting, editing commands, and preview support for Markdown documents.
;; It supports core Markdown syntax as well as extensions like GitHub Flavored
;; Markdown (GFM).
(use-package markdown-mode
  :commands (gfm-mode
             gfm-view-mode
             markdown-mode
             markdown-view-mode)
  :mode (("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode)
         ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode)
         ("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode))
  :init
  (setq markdown-command "multimarkdown")

  :bind
  (:map markdown-mode-map
        ("C-c C-e" . markdown-do)))
```

This configuration sets up `markdown-mode` with deferred loading to improve startup performance. The `:commands` and `:mode` keywords ensure that the mode is loaded only when needed—for example, when opening `.md`, `.markdown`, or `README.md` files. Files named `README.md` are specifically associated with `gfm-mode`, which is for GitHub Flavored Markdown syntax. The `markdown-command` variable is set to `"multimarkdown"` to specify the Markdown processor used for previews and exports. Additionally, a keybinding (`C-c C-e`) is defined in `markdown-mode-map` to invoke `markdown-do`, which can be customized to perform common Markdown-related actions.

### Tree-sitter Integration (Better Syntax Highlighting)

Tree-sitter is an incremental parsing system introduced in Emacs 29 that provides precise, high-performance syntax analysis and highlighting by constructing concrete syntax trees from source code. It supports a broad set of programming languages, including Bash, C, C++, C#, CMake, CSS, Dockerfile, Go, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Python, Rust, TOML, TypeScript, YAML, Elisp, Lua, Markdown, and many others. Unlike traditional font-lock, which relies on regular expressions, Tree-sitter uses formal grammar definitions to build real-time parse trees, enabling accurate syntax highlighting, structural navigation, code folding, and foundational support for advanced editing features like refactoring.

The configuration below enables Tree-sitter support using the [treesit-auto](https://github.com/renzmann/treesit-auto) package. Setting `treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist` to `'all` ensures that all available Tree-sitter modes are automatically activated for their corresponding file types. Enabling `global-treesit-auto-mode` applies this behavior globally, improving syntax accuracy and consistency across supported languages.

To enable Tree-sitter, add the following to your `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:

```elisp
;; Tree-sitter in Emacs is an incremental parsing system introduced in Emacs 29
;; that provides precise, high-performance syntax highlighting. It supports a
;; broad set of programming languages, including Bash, C, C++, C#, CMake, CSS,
;; Dockerfile, Go, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Python, Rust, TOML, TypeScript, YAML,
;; Elisp, Lua, Markdown, and many others.
(use-package treesit-auto
  :ensure t
  :custom
  (treesit-auto-install 'prompt)
  :config
  (treesit-auto-add-to-auto-mode-alist 'all)
  (global-treesit-auto-mode))
```

### Auto upgrade Emacs packages

The `auto-package-update` package that automates the process of updating installed packages managed by *package.el*. Instead of requiring users to manually invoke `package-list-packages` and update each package, `auto-package-update` can check for available updates at regular intervals, perform updates in the background, and optionally hide the results buffer or prompt before applying changes.

To configure **auto-package-update**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:

```elisp
;; This automates the process of updating installed packages
(use-package auto-package-update
  :ensure t
  :custom
  ;; Set the number of days between automatic updates.
  ;; Here, packages will only be updated if at least 7 days have passed
  ;; since the last successful update.
  (auto-package-update-interval 7)

  ;; Suppress display of the *auto-package-update results* buffer after updates.
  ;; This keeps the user interface clean and avoids unnecessary interruptions.
  (auto-package-update-hide-results t)

  ;; Automatically delete old package versions after updates to reduce disk
  ;; usage and keep the package directory clean. This prevents the accumulation
  ;; of outdated files in Emacs’s package directory, which consume
  ;; unnecessary disk space over time.
  (auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t)

  ;; Uncomment the following line to enable a confirmation prompt
  ;; before applying updates. This can be useful if you want manual control.
  ;; (auto-package-update-prompt-before-update t)

  :config
  ;; Run package updates automatically at startup, but only if the configured
  ;; interval has elapsed.
  (auto-package-update-maybe)

  ;; Schedule a background update attempt daily at 10:00 AM.
  ;; This uses Emacs' internal timer system. If Emacs is running at that time,
  ;; the update will be triggered. Otherwise, the update is skipped for that
  ;; day. Note that this scheduled update is independent of
  ;; `auto-package-update-maybe` and can be used as a complementary or
  ;; alternative mechanism.
  (auto-package-update-at-time "10:00"))
```

### Treemacs, a tree layout file explorer (Sidebar file explorer)

The [treemacs](https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs) package is a file and project explorer for Emacs that provides a visually structured tree layout similar to file browsers in modern IDEs. It integrates well with various Emacs packages such as `projectile`, `lsp-mode`, and `magit`, allowing users to navigate their project structure efficiently.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs/refs/heads/master/screenshots/screenshot.png)

To configure **treemacs**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```elisp

### Inhibit the mouse

The [inhibit-mouse](https://github.com/jamescherti/inhibit-mouse.el) package disables mouse input in Emacs.

This package is useful for users who want to disable the mouse to:
- Prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that may unexpectedly change the cursor position.
- Reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow by discouraging reliance on the mouse for navigation.

To configure **inhibit-mouse**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```emacs-lisp
;; This package is useful for users who want to disable the mouse to:
;; - Prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that may unexpectedly change
;;   the cursor position.
;; - Reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow by discouraging reliance on the mouse
;;   for navigation.
(use-package inhibit-mouse
  :ensure t
  :config
  (if (daemonp)
      (add-hook 'server-after-make-frame-hook #'inhibit-mouse-mode)
    (inhibit-mouse-mode 1)))
```

NOTE: `inhibit-mouse-mode` allows users to disable and re-enable mouse functionality, giving them the flexibility to use the mouse when needed.

### Spell checker

The `flyspell` package is a built-in Emacs minor mode that provides on-the-fly spell checking. It highlights misspelled words as you type, offering interactive corrections. In text modes, it checks the entire buffer, while in programming modes, it typically checks only comments and strings. It integrates with external spell checkers like `aspell`, `hunspell`, or `ispell` to provide suggestions and corrections.

To configure **flyspell**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
(use-package ispell
  :ensure nil
  :commands (ispell ispell-minor-mode)
  :custom
  ;; Set the ispell program name to aspell
  (ispell-program-name "aspell")

  ;; Configures Aspell's suggestion mode to "ultra", which provides more
  ;; aggressive and detailed suggestions for misspelled words. The language
  ;; is set to "en_US" for US English, which can be replaced with your desired
  ;; language code (e.g., "en_GB" for British English, "de_DE" for German).
  (ispell-extra-args '("--sug-mode=ultra" "--lang=en_US")))

;; The flyspell package is a built-in Emacs minor mode that provides
;; on-the-fly spell checking. It highlights misspelled words as you type,
;; offering interactive corrections.
(use-package flyspell
  :ensure nil
  :commands flyspell-mode
  :hook
  ((prog-mode . flyspell-prog-mode)
   (text-mode . (lambda()
                  (if (or (derived-mode-p 'yaml-mode)
                          (derived-mode-p 'yaml-ts-mode)
                          (derived-mode-p 'ansible-mode))
                      (flyspell-prog-mode)
                    (flyspell-mode 1)))))
  :config
  ;; Remove strings from Flyspell
  (setq flyspell-prog-text-faces (delq 'font-lock-string-face
                                       flyspell-prog-text-faces))

  ;; Remove doc from Flyspell
  (setq flyspell-prog-text-faces (delq 'font-lock-doc-face
                                       flyspell-prog-text-faces)))
```

### Asynchronous code formatting without cursor disruption

[Apheleia](https://github.com/radian-software/apheleia) is an Emacs package designed to run code formatters asynchronously without disrupting the cursor position. Code formatters like Shfmt, Black and Prettier ensure consistency and improve collaboration by automating formatting, but running them on save can introduce latency (e.g., Black takes around 200ms on an empty file) and unpredictably move the cursor when modifying nearby text.

Apheleia solves both problems across all languages, replacing language-specific packages like Blacken and prettier-js. It does this by invoking formatters in an `after-save-hook`, ensuring changes are applied only if the buffer remains unmodified.

To maintain cursor stability, Apheleia generates an RCS patch, applies it selectively, and employs a dynamic programming algorithm to reposition the cursor if necessary. If the formatting alters the vertical position of the cursor in the window, Apheleia adjusts the scroll position to preserve visual continuity across all displayed instances of the buffer. This allows enjoying automated code formatting without sacrificing editor responsiveness or usability.

To configure **apheleia**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```elisp
;; Apheleia is an Emacs package designed to run code formatters (e.g., Shfmt,
;; Black and Prettier) asynchronously without disrupting the cursor position.
(use-package apheleia
  :ensure t
  :commands (apheleia-mode
             apheleia-global-mode)
  :hook ((prog-mode . apheleia-mode)))
```

### A better Emacs *help* buffer

Helpful is an alternative to the built-in Emacs help that provides much more contextual information.

To configure **helpful**, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```emacs-lisp
;; Helpful is an alternative to the built-in Emacs help that provides much more
;; contextual information.
(use-package helpful
  :ensure t
  :commands (helpful-callable
             helpful-variable
             helpful-key
             helpful-command
             helpful-at-point
             helpful-function)
  :bind
  ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
  ([remap describe-function] . helpful-callable)
  ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)
  ([remap describe-symbol] . helpful-symbol)
  ([remap describe-variable] . helpful-variable)
  :custom
  (helpful-max-buffers 7))
```

### Enhancing the Elisp development experience

To enhance the Elisp development experience, add the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
```emacs-lisp
;; Enables automatic indentation of code while typing
(use-package aggressive-indent
  :ensure t
  :commands aggressive-indent-mode
  :hook
  (emacs-lisp-mode . aggressive-indent-mode))

;; Highlights function and variable definitions in Emacs Lisp mode
(use-package highlight-defined
  :ensure t
  :commands highlight-defined-mode
  :hook
  (emacs-lisp-mode . highlight-defined-mode))
```

Other optional packages that may be useful include:
```emacs-lisp
;; Prevent parenthesis imbalance
(use-package paredit
  :ensure t
  :commands paredit-mode
  :hook
  (emacs-lisp-mode . paredit-mode)
  :config
  (define-key paredit-mode-map (kbd "RET") nil))

;; For paredit+Evil mode users: enhances paredit with Evil mode compatibility
;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; (use-package enhanced-evil-paredit
;;   :ensure t
;;   :commands enhanced-evil-paredit-mode
;;   :hook
;;   (paredit-mode . enhanced-evil-paredit-mode))

;; Displays visible indicators for page breaks
(use-package page-break-lines
  :ensure t
  :commands (page-break-lines-mode
             global-page-break-lines-mode)
  :hook
  (emacs-lisp-mode . page-break-lines-mode))

;; Provides functions to find references to functions, macros, variables,
;; special forms, and symbols in Emacs Lisp
(use-package elisp-refs
  :ensure t
  :commands (elisp-refs-function
             elisp-refs-macro
             elisp-refs-variable
             elisp-refs-special
             elisp-refs-symbol))
```

### Showing the tab-bar

Configure the `tab-bar-show` variable to 1 to display the tab bar exclusively when multiple tabs are open:
```elisp
;; Configure the `tab-bar-show` variable to 1 to display the tab bar exclusively
;; when multiple tabs are open:
(setopt tab-bar-show 1)
```

### Preventing Emacs from saving custom.el

To prevent Emacs from saving customization information to a custom file, set `custom-file` to `null-device` by adding to the following to `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Prevent Emacs from saving customization information to a custom file
(setq custom-file null-device)
```

### Changing the Default Font

To customize the default font, add the following expression to your `~/.emacs.d/post-init.el`:

```elisp
;; Set the default font to DejaVu Sans Mono with specific size and weight
(set-face-attribute 'default nil
                    :height 130 :weight 'normal :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
```

- Modify the `':weight`' value to control the font thickness/boldness. It must be one of the following symbols: `'ultra-heavy`, `'heavy` (a.k.a. `'black`), `'ultra-bold` (a.k.a. `'extra-bold`), `'bold`, `'semi-bold` (a.k.a. `'demi-bold`), `'medium`, `'normal` (a.k.a. `'regular`, a.k.a. `'book`), `'semi-light` (a.k.a. `'demi-light`), `'light`, `'extra-light` (a.k.a. `'ultra-light`), or `'thin`.
- Modify the :height value to set the font size, where 100 corresponds to 10 pt, 130 to 13 pt, and so on.
- Modify the `:family` value to specify a different font, according to your preference. You can replace it with, for example, "Iosevka Term", "Inconsolata", "JetBrains Mono", "Source Code Pro", or "Hack". (The authors preferred font family is "Iosevka Term", medium weight.)

On Linux, you can display a comprehensive list of all installed font families by executing the following command:
```
fc-list : family | sed 's/,/\n/g' | sort -u
```

## Customizations: pre-early-init.el

### Reducing clutter in `~/.emacs.d` by redirecting files to `~/.emacs.d/var/`

Emacs, by default, stores various configuration files, caches, backups, and other data in the `~/.emacs.d` directory. Over time, this directory can become cluttered with numerous files, making it difficult to manage and maintain.

A common solution to this issue is installing the no-littering package; however, this package is not essential.

An alternative lightweight approach is to simply change the default `~/.emacs.d` directory to `~/.emacs.d/var/`, which will contain all the files that Emacs typically stores in the base directory. This can be accomplished by adding the following code to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Reducing clutter in ~/.emacs.d by redirecting files to ~/.emacs.d/var/
;; IMPORTANT: This part should be in the pre-early-init.el file
(setq minimal-emacs-var-dir (expand-file-name "var/" minimal-emacs-user-directory))
(setq package-user-dir (expand-file-name "elpa" minimal-emacs-var-dir))
(setq user-emacs-directory minimal-emacs-var-dir)
```

**IMPORTANT:** The code above should be added to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`, not the other files, as it modifies the behavior of all subsequent init files.

### Configuring straight.el

The `straight.el` package is a declarative package manager for Emacs that aims to replace traditional systems like `package.el` by providing more precise control over package installation and management. Unlike `package.el`, which relies on downloading pre-built packages from ELPA archives, `straight.el` clones packages directly from their source repositories (typically Git), enabling reproducible and fully source-controlled package configurations.

[Add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to `~/.emacs.d/pre-init.el`:
``` emacs-lisp
;; Straight bootstrap
(defvar bootstrap-version)
(let ((bootstrap-file
       (expand-file-name
        "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el"
        (or (bound-and-true-p straight-base-dir)
            user-emacs-directory)))
      (bootstrap-version 7))
  (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
    (with-current-buffer
        (url-retrieve-synchronously
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/radian-software/straight.el/develop/install.el"
         'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
      (goto-char (point-max))
      (eval-print-last-sexp)))
  (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))
```

### Configuring elpaca (package manager)

Elpaca is a modern, asynchronous package manager for Emacs designed to be a drop-in replacement for `package.el` and `straight.el`, with enhanced performance and flexibility. Unlike traditional Emacs package managers, Elpaca installs packages asynchronously, allowing Emacs to remain responsive during installation and updates.

Add to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`:
```elisp
;; By default, minimal-emacs-package-initialize-and-refresh is set to t, which
;; makes minimal-emacs.d call the built-in package manager. Since Elpaca will
;; replace the package manager, there is no need to call it.
(setq minimal-emacs-package-initialize-and-refresh nil)
```

And [add the elpaca bootstrap code](https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca?tab=readme-ov-file#installer) to `~/.emacs.d/pre-init.el`:
```elisp
;; Elpaca bootstrap
(defvar elpaca-installer-version 0.11)
(defvar elpaca-directory (expand-file-name "elpaca/" user-emacs-directory))
(defvar elpaca-builds-directory (expand-file-name "builds/" elpaca-directory))
(defvar elpaca-repos-directory (expand-file-name "repos/" elpaca-directory))
(defvar elpaca-order '(elpaca :repo "https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca.git"
                              :ref nil :depth 1 :inherit ignore
                              :files (:defaults "elpaca-test.el" (:exclude "extensions"))
                              :build (:not elpaca--activate-package)))
(let* ((repo  (expand-file-name "elpaca/" elpaca-repos-directory))
       (build (expand-file-name "elpaca/" elpaca-builds-directory))
       (order (cdr elpaca-order))
       (default-directory repo))
  (add-to-list 'load-path (if (file-exists-p build) build repo))

                                                      (list (format "--depth=%d" depth) "--no-single-branch"))
                                                  ,(plist-get order :repo) ,repo))))
                  ((zerop (call-process "git" nil buffer t "checkout"

                  ((zerop (call-process emacs nil buffer nil "-Q" "-L" "." "--batch"
                                        "--eval" "(byte-recompile-directory \".\" 0 'force)")))
                  ((require 'elpaca))
                  ((elpaca-generate-autoloads "elpaca" repo)))
            (progn (message "%s" (buffer-string)) (kill-buffer buffer))
          (error "%s" (with-current-buffer buffer (buffer-string))))
      ((error) (warn "%s" err) (delete-directory repo 'recursive))))
  (unless (require 'elpaca-autoloads nil t)
    (require 'elpaca)
    (elpaca-generate-autoloads "elpaca" repo)
    (let ((load-source-file-function nil)) (load "./elpaca-autoloads"))))
(add-hook 'after-init-hook #'elpaca-process-queues)
(elpaca `(,@elpaca-order))

## Frequently asked questions

### Customizing Scroll Recentering

By default, minimal-emacs.d sets `scroll-conservatively` to `101`:

```emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-conservatively 101)  ; Default minimal-emacs.d value
```

A value of `101` minimizes screen movement and maintains point visibility with minimal adjustment, which many users find optimal for rapid navigation.

You can override this in your `post-init.el` file. Setting it to `0` forces Emacs to recenter the point aggressively, typically positioning it in the middle of the window:

```emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-conservatively 0)  ; NOT RECOMMENDED. SET IT TO 101 INSTEAD.
```

Although this offers more surrounding context, it results in frequent and pronounced screen movement, which can disrupt navigation. A value of `0` is generally discouraged unless this behavior is explicitly desired.

Most users prefer `101`. Some select `10` as a compromise:

```emacs-lisp
(setq scroll-conservatively 10)  ; Note: You might prefer 101 over 10.
```

A value of `10` permits occasional recentering for additional context but introduces more movement than `101`.

### How to display Emacs startup duration?

To measure and display the time taken for Emacs to start, you can use the following Emacs Lisp function. This function will report both the startup duration and the number of garbage collections that occurred during initialization.

Add the following to your `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el` file:
```emacs-lisp
(defun display-startup-time ()
  "Display the startup time and number of garbage collections."
  (message "Emacs init loaded in %.2f seconds (Full emacs-startup: %.2fs) with %d garbage collections."
           (float-time (time-subtract after-init-time before-init-time))
           (time-to-seconds (time-since before-init-time))
           gcs-done))

(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'display-startup-time 100)
```

(Alternatively, you may use the built-in `M-x emacs-init-time` command to obtain the startup duration. However, `emacs-init-time` does not account for the portion of the startup process that occurs after `after-init-time`.)

### How to use MELPA stable?

**Note: The minimal-emacs.d author does not recommend using MELPA Stable. Use MELPA instead, which is enabled by default in the minimal-emacs.d configuration.**

By default, *minimal-emacs.d* uses [MELPA](https://melpa.org/) instead of [MELPA Stable](https://stable.melpa.org/) because MELPA Stable offers outdated packages that lack essential features. If you prefer to use MELPA Stable, you may follow the instructions below.

Here are the key differences between **MELPA** (the default repository used in minimal-emacs.d) and **MELPA Stable**:
- **MELPA** (preferred) is a rolling release repository for Emacs packages, where packages are continuously updated with the latest commits from their respective development branches, delivering the most current features and bug fixes. While MELPA features the latest changes, most Emacs package developers have learned to maintain a relatively stable master branch, which contributes to MELPA’s overall stability. Furthermore, MELPA includes a broader selection of packages.
- In contrast, **MELPA Stable** is a repository that hosts versioned, tagged releases of packages. However, **MELPA Stable does not guarantee more reliability than MELPA, as its tagged versions may still suffer from issues** like uncoordinated dependencies or incomplete testing, and updates are less frequent, often based on developer discretion rather than every new commit.

If you prefer MELPA Stable over MELPA, you can add MELPA Stable and prioritize it. To ensure packages are fetched from MELPA Stable first, add the following configuration to `~/.emacs.d/post-early-init.el`:

```elisp
;; Add melpa-stable to `package-archives'
(push '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") package-archives)

;; This change increases MELPA Stable priority to 70, above MELPA,
;; ensuring that MELPA is preferred for package installations
;; over MELPA Stable.
(setq package-archive-priorities '(("gnu"    . 99)
                                   ("nongnu" . 80)
                                   ("melpa-stable" . 70)
                                   ("melpa"  . 0)))
```

### How to load a local lisp file for machine-specific configurations?

Add the following line to the end of your `post-init.el` file:
```lisp
(minimal-emacs-load-user-init "local.el")
```

This allows `local.el` to load, enabling custom configurations specific to the machine.

(Ensure that `local.el` is in the same directory as `post-init.el`.)

### How to load Emacs customizations?

To load customizations saved by Emacs (`M-x customize`), add the following code snippet to the `post-init.el` file. This ensures that the custom file, typically set to a separate file for user preferences, is loaded without errors or messages during startup:

```elisp
(load custom-file 'noerror 'nomessage)
```

However, rather than relying on customizations loaded with the code above, the author recommends configuring Emacs through init files (just as you are doing by reading this README.md and customizing packages using `use-package` with the `:custom` keyword).

### How to increase gc-cons-threshold?

Add the following to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el` to ensure that *minimal-emacs.d* restores the specified amount after startup:
```emacs-lisp
(setq minimal-emacs-gc-cons-threshold (* 64 1024 1024))
```

### How to prevent Emacs from loading .dir-locals.el files?

By default, Emacs loads `.dir-locals.el` from the current directory or its parents and applies project-specific settings such as indentation, compilation commands, or custom minor modes. While useful in many cases, this behavior can introduce unintended overrides, inconsistencies, or even security risks when working with untrusted projects.

If you want to prevent Emacs from applying these directory-local settings, you can disable `.dir-locals.el` by setting `enable-dir-local-variables` to `nil`:

``` emacs-lisp
(setq enable-dir-local-variables nil)
```

### How to make minimal-emacs.d use an environment variable to change ~/.emacs.d to another directory?

Add the following to the top of the `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el` file to make *minimal-emacs.d* use the `MINIMAL_EMACS_USER_DIRECTORY` environment variable to change `~/.emacs.d` to another directory:
```emacs-lisp
;; Place this at the very beginning of pre-early-init.el
(let ((previous-minimal-emacs-user-directory (expand-file-name
                                              minimal-emacs-user-directory))
      (env-dir (getenv "MINIMAL_EMACS_USER_DIRECTORY")))
  (setq minimal-emacs-user-directory (if env-dir
                                         (expand-file-name env-dir)
                                       (expand-file-name user-emacs-directory)))
  (unless (string= minimal-emacs-user-directory
                   previous-minimal-emacs-user-directory)
    ;; Load pre-early-init.el from the new directory
    (minimal-emacs-load-user-init "pre-early-init.el")))
```

### Are post-early-init.el and pre-init.el the same file in terms of the logic?

During the execution of `early-init.el` (and `pre-early-init.el` and  `post-early-init.el`), Emacs has not yet loaded the graphical user interface (GUI). This file is used for configurations that need to be applied before the GUI is initialized, such as settings that affect the early stages of the Emacs startup process.

Thus, `post-early-init.el` and `pre-init.el` serve different purposes and are not the same.

### Why is the menu bar disabled by default?

The menu bar is disabled by default in *minimal-emacs.d* to provide a minimal, distraction-free environment, which many experienced users prefer.

The menu bar can be re-enabled by adding the following configuration to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`:
```elisp
(setq minimal-emacs-ui-features '(menu-bar))
```

Other UI features can also be enabled by adding the following to `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el`:
```elisp
(setq minimal-emacs-ui-features '(context-menu tool-bar menu-bar dialogs tooltips horizontal-scroll-bars vertical-scroll-bars))
```

### Why did the author develop minimal-emacs.d?

The author began working on it after realizing that no existing starter kit offered a truly minimal setup with the flexibility for users to choose exactly what to include in their configuration.

### How to keep minimal-emacs.d pre-\*.el and post-\*.el files in a separate directory?

To ensure the *minimal-emacs.d* configuration loads `post-early-init.el`, `pre-init.el`, and `post-init.el` from a different directory, such as `~/.config/minimal-emacs.d/`, modify the `minimal-emacs-user-directory` variable by adding the following to your `~/.emacs.d/pre-early-init.el` file:
```elisp
(setq minimal-emacs-user-directory "~/.config/minimal-emacs.d/")
```

This will ensure that the *minimal-emacs.d* configuration loads `post-early-init.el`, `pre-init.el`, and `post-init.el` from `~/.config/minimal-emacs.d/`.

Keep in mind that if you change the `minimal-emacs-user-directory`, *minimal-emacs.d* will attempt to load the rest of the configuration from that directory (e.g., `~/.config/minimal-emacs/post-early-init.el`, `~/.config/minimal-emacs/pre-init.el` and `~/.config/minimal-emacs/post-init.el`, etc.).

### How to make *minimal-emacs.d* install packages in the early-init phase instead of the init phase?

To install and load packages during the early-init phase, add the following to `post-early-init.el`:

```elisp
(setq minimal-emacs-package-initialize-and-refresh nil)

;; If you want to ignore the warning:
;; "Warning (package): Unnecessary call to package-initialize in init file."
;; Uncomment the following setq:
;; (setq warning-suppress-types '((package)))

;; Initialize packages in the early-init phase instead of init
(progn
  (package-initialize)
  (unless package-archive-contents
    (package-refresh-contents))
  (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
    (package-install 'use-package))
  (eval-when-compile
    (require 'use-package)))

;; TODO: Add your use-package code here
```

A drawback of using the early-init phase instead of init is that if a package fails (e.g, due to a network issue), no output will be displayed in the Emacs GUI. You will need to open a terminal to view Emacs's stdout for error messages.
